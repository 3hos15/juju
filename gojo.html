                    <h2>Character</h2>
                    <p>Gojo Satoru is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade
                        jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the
                        Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred
                        years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and
                        train strong young allies.</p>

                <p>Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late twenties. He has snow-white hair and
                    the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold
                    which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru
                    will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.</p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>Gojo is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself
                    to be invincible. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant.
                </p>
                <p>He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his
                    fight with Toji Fushiguro, that <q>throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored
                        one.</q></p>
                <!-- This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.
                
                He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members that were laughing over Riko's death, though was stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — before taking any action. -->

                <p>Furthermore, Gojo was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Geto, his one and
                    only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Gojo attempted to reason with his friend, but
                    eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal. After having
                    to put an end to Geto before more calamity arose, it was Gojo's trauma over losing his best friend
                    that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya.</p>

                <p>Gojo's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up through education. He seeks to
                    foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.</p>

                    <p>Even among the special grade sorcerers, Gojo is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series,
                        holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can
                        seemingly match his skill level in the current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.

                    <h3>Immeasurable Cursed Energy</h3>
                    <p>Gojo is known within the jujutsu society as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer in the world. He
                        earned this alias due to the immense amounts of cursed energy he possesses. His cursed energy is
                        vast enough to use a Domain Expansion at least five times in one day, while most sorcerers can
                        only use it once.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h4>Limitless (無む下か限げん Mukagen)</h4>
                        <img src="images/limitless-gojo.gif" alt="Gojo Limitless">
                        <p>At the base level, Limitless is an innate technique which is derived from the Gojo family.
                            This technique grants its users nigh-absolute control over space through cursed energy
                            manipulation at an atomic level, resulting in multiple subsequent results and techniques
                            within the overall ability. With the manipulation of space as just the base level of the
                            technique, Limitless has three standard and one "non-standard" form beyond this.</p>
                        <h4>Hollow Technique: Purple (虚式「茈」Kyoshiki・Murasaki)</h4>
                        <img src="images/gojohollowpurple.webp" alt="Gojo Hollow Purple">
                        <p>An advanced technique that collides the Lapse and Reversal of the Limitless, resulting in an
                            imaginary mass that is launched at the target.</p>
                        <h4>Unlimited Void (無量空処 Muryōkūsho)</h4>
                        <p>Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive
                            all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and
                            actions. Those he makes physical contact with are also immune to its effect.</p>

                        <img src="images/gojosixeyes.webp" alt="Gojo Six Eyes">
                        <p>Not much is known about the Six Eyes, but it is known that they play some role in the precise
                            usage of the Limitless. It has been stated that similar to Limitless, Six Eyes is also an
                            Innate Technique inherited through the Gojo family. Yuta has stated that the Six Eyes allows
                            Satoru to reduce his cursed energy consumption from technique activation infinitesimally
                            near to nothing, and that he will never run out of cursed energy in a fight as a result.</p>
